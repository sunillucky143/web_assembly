# Visual Frontend Development Platform

A revolutionary visual front-end development platform that combines the power of design tools like Figma with actual code generation and component wiring. Build real front-end applications using a visual canvas interface, similar to how you design in Figma but with the ability to generate working code.

## 🎯 Vision

This platform aims to make front-end development more accessible and efficient by providing:

- **Visual Component Assembly**: Drag and drop pre-built components onto a canvas
- **Automatic Wiring**: Components placed in containers are automatically connected
- **Manual Wiring**: Create custom logic connections between components
- **Code Generation**: Switch between visual design and actual code
- **Multi-Page Support**: Build complete web applications with page navigation
- **Real-Time Preview**: See your changes instantly as you build

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Visual Design Interface
- **Component Palette**: Browse and search through available UI components
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive component placement on the workspace
- **Real-time Editing**: Modify component properties through visual controls
- **Responsive Design**: Components automatically adapt to different screen sizes

### 🔌 Component Wiring System
- **Automatic Connections**: Components in containers are automatically wired
- **Manual Wiring**: Create custom logic flows between components
- **Event Handling**: Define what happens when components interact
- **Data Flow**: Visual representation of data passing between components

### 🖥️ Multi-Mode Interface
- **Design Mode**: Visual canvas for component arrangement
- **Code Mode**: Edit the underlying code directly
- **Preview Mode**: See the final result in real-time

### 🎛️ Customization Panels
- **Style Panel**: Modify colors, typography, borders, and shadows
- **Layout Panel**: Adjust positioning, sizing, and spacing
- **Content Panel**: Edit text content and component properties
- **Parameters Panel**: Define external data connections and API integrations

### 📱 Multi-Page Application Support
- **Page Navigation**: Switch between different pages in your application
- **Infinite Scroll Workspace**: Visual representation of your entire web app
- **Page-to-Page Wiring**: Connect components across different pages

## 🧩 Core Components

### Workspace Canvas
The main area where you assemble your application:
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large workspaces with intuitive controls
- **Grid System**: Visual alignment guides for precise component placement
- **Drop Zones**: Clear indicators for component placement

### Component Palette
Browse and search available components:
- **Categories**: Organized by component type and function
- **Search**: Find components quickly with intelligent search
- **Grid/List Views**: Choose your preferred browsing style
- **Framework Support**: Components from React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JS

### Customization Panels
Modify component appearance and behavior:
- **Style Controls**: Color pickers, typography settings, border controls
- **Layout Controls**: Position, size, spacing, and alignment
- **Content Controls**: Text editing, property modification
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes instantly as you make them

### Parameters Panel
Define external integrations:
- **Input Parameters**: Data that flows into your components
- **Output Parameters**: Data that flows out of your components
- **API Connections**: External service integrations
- **Data Validation**: Type checking and required field management

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Components
1. Create component definition in the types
2. Add component to the palette
3. Implement component logic
4. Add customization options

### Extending the Platform
